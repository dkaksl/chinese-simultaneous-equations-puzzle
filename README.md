Program to solve a simultaneous equations puzzle

This project aims to solve a math puzzle found floating around in the Chinese interwebs.

The original solution is just a brute-force solution ported from [an answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1748081/332513) to one of my questions on the Stack Exchange network. Similarly, contributions have been generated from [a further set of question and answers](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/126071/74727) on the Stack Exchange network.
